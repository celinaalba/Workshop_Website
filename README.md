## Scope
  # This workshop will cover a number of aspects related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Novel methods used for COVID-19 detection using deep learning and distributed computing methods will be described. Innovative machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques applied to chest CT and x-ray images to identify features of interest in COVID-19 patients, improve accuracy of diagnosis, identify illness severity, and study the spread and long-term effects will be presented. Wireless, non-invasive sensors for COVID-19 detection will be described, including sensor technology that can detect COVID-19 infections, low-cost and portable devices for remote patient monitoring and virtual assessments, and other types of sensors for monitoring COVID-19. Innovative methods for improving accuracy, fast response time, multiplexing capabilities, multiple sensing modes, disposability, long shelf life, ease of use, cost-effectiveness, manufacturability, and autonomy will be presented. Legal, ethical, and privacy concerns surrounding sensor technology and associated data will be discussed. Methods from nanotechnology and the Internet of things will be described as they are applicable to COVID-19 sensor technology. 
  # Furthermore, this workshop will cover informatics and standardization techniques for archiving multimodal data related to COVID-19. Large amounts of data are needed for the types of machine learning methods that will be discussed. Quality control of imaging data will be discussed, and various metrics will be described. Web-based interactive data visualization platforms will be presented as well as user interfaces and graphical tools for integrated data processing to explore data and access pipeline workflows. Distributed computing applied to COVID-19 will be described for various types of data. For example, distributed computing has accelerated COVID-19 research in molecular dynamics as it allows people around the world to make their computers available to researchers for effective virtual screening of chemical compounds. Various types of distributed architectures, including clusters, grids, and clouds, that are being used to accelerate COVID-19 research will be discussed. Distributed computing encourages international collaboration and enables access to richer datasets.
